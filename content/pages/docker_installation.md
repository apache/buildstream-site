title: BuildStream inside Docker
save_as: docker_installation.html

If your system cannot provide the base system requirements for BuildStream, then it is possible to run buildstream within a Docker image.

The BuildStream project provides
[Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildstream/buildstream-fedora>)
containing BuildStream and its dependencies.
This gives you an easy way to get started using BuildStream on any Unix-like
platform where Docker is available, including Mac OS X.

We recommend using the
[`bst-here` wrapper script](https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream/blob/master/contrib/bst-here)
which automates the necessary container setup. You can download it and make
it executable like this:

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl --get https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream/raw/master/contrib/bst-here > ~/.local/bin/bst-here
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/bst-here
```

Check if `~/.local/bin` appears in your `PATH` environment variable -- if it
doesn't, you should
[edit your `~/.profile` so that it does](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/).

Once the script is available in your `PATH`, you can run `bst-here` to open a
shell session inside a new container based off the latest version of the
buildstream-fedora Docker image. The current working directory will be mounted
inside the container at `/src`.

You can also run individual BuildStream commands as `bst-here COMMAND`. For
example: `bst-here show systems/my-system.bst`. Note that BuildStream won't
be able to integrate with Bash tab-completion if you invoke it in this way.

Two Docker volumes are set up by the `bst-here` script:

 - `buildstream-cache --` mounted at `~/.cache/buildstream`
 - `buildstream-config --` mounted at `~/.config/`

These are necessary so that your BuildStream cache and configuration files
persist between invocations of `bst-here`.
