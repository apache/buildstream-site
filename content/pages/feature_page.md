## Try BuildStream 1.2 out!

If you want to try BuildStream 1.2 you must go through these two pages carefully:

* Until BuildStream gets official support from major distributions, the recommended way to [install BuildStream 1.2] is through [PyPI].
* All releases sources, including BuildStream 1.2, are available for [download].

The issues which may impact your experience early on are documented in the [Known Issues] page, with workarounds and links to the issue tickets, so you can keep up to date with developments.

Feel free to take a look at our [bug list] if you do not find a solution for the issue you have, join the #buildstream [IRC channel] to get immediate support or join the BuildStream [Community mailing list] and ask questions there if they need to be more elaborate.

## I have installed BuildStream 1.2, now what?

Have you already installed BuildStream 1.2 successfully? Then the next step should be to try the [Hello World! example] to get a sense of how the tool works. There are [more complex examples] you can try out next.

Find out more about BuildStream features, architecture and further technical details on the [BuildStream In Detail] page.
